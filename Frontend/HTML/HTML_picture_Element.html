    <h3>The HTML picture Element</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The HTML picture element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.
            <br><br>
            The picture> element contains one or more
            source elements, each referring to different images through the srcset attribute. This way the browser can
            choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.
            <br><br>
            Each source element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.

    <h3>When to use the Picture Element</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            There are two main purposes for the picture element:
            <br><br>
            1. Bandwidth <br>
            If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use
            the first
            source element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.
            <br><br>
            2. Format Support <br>
            Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the picture element, you can add images
            of all
            formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements.
