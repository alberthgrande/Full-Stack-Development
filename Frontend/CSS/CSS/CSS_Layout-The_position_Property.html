            </header>
            <p>
                The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative,
                fixed, absolute or
                sticky).

            </header>

            <p>
                The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
                <br><br>
                There are five different position values:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>static</li>
                <li>relative</li>
                <li>fixed</li>
                <li>absolute</li>
                <li>sticky</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these
                properties will not work
                unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.
            </p>

        <section>
            <header>
                <h3>position: static;</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                HTML elements are positioned static by default.
                <br><br>
                Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
                <br><br>
                An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned
                according to the normal
                flow of the page:
                <br><br>
                This div element has position: static;
                Here is the CSS that is used:
            </p>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section>
            <header>
                <h3>position: relative;</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
                <br><br>
                Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to
                be adjusted away
                from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
                <br><br>
                This div element has position: relative;
                Here is the CSS that is used:
            </p>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section>
            <header>
                <h3>position: fixed;</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in
                the same place
                even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the
                element.
                <br><br>
                A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
                <br><br>
                Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:
            </p>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section>
            <header>
                <h3>position: absolute;</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead
                of positioned
                relative to the viewport, like fixed).
                <br><br>
                However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and
                moves along with
                page scrolling.
                <br><br>
                Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
                <br><br>
                Here is a simple example:
            </p>
            <code>

                div.relative { <br>
                &nbsp;position: relative; <br>
                &nbsp;width: 400px; <br>
                &nbsp;height: 200px; <br>
                &nbsp;border: 3px solid #73AD21; <br>
                }
                
                <br><br>
                div.absolute { <br>
                &nbsp;position: absolute; <br>
                &nbsp;top: 80px; <br>
                &nbsp;right: 0; <br>
                &nbsp;width: 200px; <br>
                &nbsp;height: 100px; <br>
                &nbsp;border: 3px solid #73AD21; <br>
                }
            </code>
        </section>

        <hr>

        <section>
            <header>
                <h3>position: sticky;</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
                <br><br>
                A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned
                relative until a
                given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
                <br><br>
                Note: Internet Explorer does not support sticky positioning. Safari requires a -webkit- prefix (see
                example below). You
                must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.
            </p>
            <code>
                div.sticky { <br>
                &nbsp;position: -webkit-sticky; /* Safari */ <br>
                &nbsp;position: sticky; <br>
                &nbsp;top: 0; <br>
                &nbsp;background-color: green; <br>
                &nbsp;border: 2px solid #4CAF50; <br>
                }
            </code>
