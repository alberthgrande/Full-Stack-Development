    <h1>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h1>
    <p>
        Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
        <br><br>
        There are two display values: block and inline.
    </p>

    <h3>Block-level Elements</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin)
            before and
            after the element.
            <br><br>
            A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far
            as it
            can).
            <br><br>
            Two commonly used block elements are: p and
            div.
            <br><br>
            The p element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
            <br><br>
            The div element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
            <br><br>
            Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
        </p>
        <img src="/img/block-elements.PNG" alt="block-elements">
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            An inline element does not start on a new line.
            <br><br>
            An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
            <br><br>
            This is a span element inside a paragraph.
            <br><br>
            Here are the inline elements in HTML:
        </p>
        <img src="/img/inline-elements.PNG" alt="inline-elements">
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>The div Element</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
            <br><br>
            The div element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
            <br><br>
            When used together with CSS, the div element can be used to style blocks of content:
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr>
    <h3>The span Element</h3>
    <div>
        The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
        <br><br>
        The span element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
        <br><br>
        When used together with CSS, the span element can be used to style parts of the text:
    </div>
