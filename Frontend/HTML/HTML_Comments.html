    <h1>HTML Comments</h1>
    <p>HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.</p>

    <h3>HTML Comment Tag</h3>
    <p>You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:</p>
    <p>Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.</p>
    <p>Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.</p>

    <h3>Add Comments</h3>
    <p>With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Hide Content</h3>
    <p>
        Comments can be used to hide content.
        <br><br>
        This can be helpful if you hide content temporarily:
        <br><br>
        You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display.
        <br><br>
        Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to
        search for
        errors.

    <h3>Hide Inline Content</h3>
    <p>Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code. </p>
