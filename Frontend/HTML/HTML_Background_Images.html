    <h1>HTML Background Images</h1>
    <p>A background image can be specified for almost any HTML element.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Background Image on a HTML element</h3>
    <p>
        To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image
        property:
        <br><br>
        You can also specify the background image in the style element, in the head section:
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Background Image on a Page</h3>
    <p>
        If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the
        body element:
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Background Repeat</h3>
    <p>
        If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically,
        until it
        reaches the end of the element:
        <br><br>
        To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Background Cover</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to
            cover.
            <br><br>
            Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:
            <br><br>
            This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its
            original
            proportions):
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>Background Stretch</h3>
    <p>
        If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property
        to 100%
        100%:
        <br><br>
        Try resizing the browser window, and you will see that the image will stretch, but always cover the entire
        element.
    </p>
