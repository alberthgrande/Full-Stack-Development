    <h1>HTML Page Title</h1>
    <p>Every web page should have a page title to describe the meaning of the page.</p>
    <p>The title element adds a title to your page:</p>
    <p>
        The title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.
        <br><br>
        The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine
        algorithms to
        decide the order when listing pages in search results.
        <br><br>
        The title element:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>defines a title in the browser toolbar</li>
        <li>a title for the page when it is added to favorites</li>
        <li>displays a title for the page in search engine-results</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!</p>
