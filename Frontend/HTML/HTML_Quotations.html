    <h3>HTML blockquote for Quotations</h3>
    <p>
        The HTML blockquote element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
        <br><br>
        Browsers usually indent blockquote elements.

    <h3>HTML q for Short Quotations</h3>
    <p>
        The HTML q>tag defines a short quotation.
        <br><br>
        Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML abbr for Abbreviations</h3>

    <p>
        The HTML bbr tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
        <br><br>
        Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
        <br><br>
        Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the
        element.

    <h3>HTML address for Contact Information</h3>
    <p>
        The HTML address tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
        <br><br>
        The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
        <br><br>
        The text in the address element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and
        after the address element.

    </p>

    <h3>HTML cite for Work Title</h3>
    <p>
        The HTML cite tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a
        sculpture,
        etc.).
        <br><br>
        <b>Note:</b> A person's name is not the title of a work.
        <br><br>

    <h3>HTML bdo for Bi-Directional Override</h3>
    <p>
        BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.
