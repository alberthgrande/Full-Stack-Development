            <h3>
                The clear Property
            </h3>
            <p>
                When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have
                to use the clear
                property.
                <br><br>
                The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.
                <br><br>
                The clear property can have one of the following values:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default</li>
                <li>left - The element is pushed below left floated elements</li>
                <li>right - The element is pushed below right floated elements</li>
                <li>both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements</li>
                <li>inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left,
                then you should
                clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear
                below it on the web
                page.

                Example
                <br><br>
                This example clears the float to the left. Here, it means that the div2 element is pushed below the left
                floated
                div1 element:
            </p>
            <code>

                div1 { <br>
                &nbsp;float: left; <br>
                }
                <br><br>
                div2 { <br>
                &nbsp;clear: left; <br>
                }
            </code>

                <h3>The clearfix Hack</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                If a floated element is taller than the containing element, it will "overflow" outside of its container.
                We can then add
                a clearfix hack to solve this problem:
            </p>
            <div class="clearfix1">
                <img class="img1" src="/img/pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet...
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <code>
                .clearfix { <br>
                &nbsp; overflow: auto; <br>
                }
            </code>

            <p>
                The overflow: auto clearfix works well as long as you are able to keep control of your margins and
                padding (else you
                might see scrollbars). The new, modern clearfix hack however, is safer to use, and the following code is
                used for most
                webpages:
            </p>
            <div class="clearfix2">
                <img class="img2" src="/img/pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet...
            </div>
            <p>
