    <h1>HTML Paragraphs </h1>
    <p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.</p>

    <h3>HTML Paragraphs</h3>

    <p>
        he HTML p element defines a paragraph. <br><br>
        A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and
        after a
        paragraph.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML Display</h3>

    <p>
        You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. <br><br>

        Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.<br><br>

        With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code. <br><br>

        The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:

    <h3>HTML Horizontal Rules</h3>

    <p>
        The hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        <br><br>
        The hr element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
        <br><br>
        The hr tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML Line Breaks</h3>

    <p>
        The HTML br element defines a line break.
        <br><br>
        Use br if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
        <br><br>
        The br tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag

    <p>This poem will display on a single line:</p>

    <h3>Solution - The HTML pre Element</h3>

    <p>
        The HTML pre element defines preformatted text.
        <br><br>
        The text inside a pre element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces
        and line breaks:
    </p>

    <pre>
      My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
    
      My Bonnie lies over the sea.
    
      My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
    
      Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </pre
