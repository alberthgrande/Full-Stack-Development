    <h1>HTML Image Maps</h1>
    <p>With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Image Maps</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The HTML map tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined
            with
            one
            or more area tags.
            <br><br>
            Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below:
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
    <div>
        The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the
        image you
        click.
        <br><br>
        To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.
    </div>

    <h3>The Image</h3>
    <p>
        The image is inserted using the img tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap
        attribute:
        <br><br>
        The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a
        relationship
        between the image and the image map.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Create Image Map</h3>
    <p>
        Then, add a map element.
        <br><br>
        The map element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name
        attribute:
        <br><br>
        The name attribute must have the same value as the img's usemap attribute .
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>The Areas</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Then, add the clickable areas.
            <br><br>
            A clickable area is defined using an area element.
            <br><br>
            Shape
            <br>
            You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>rect - defines a rectangular region</li>
            <li>circle - defines a circular region</li>
            <li>poly - defines a polygonal region</li>
            <li>default - defines the entire region</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>Shape="rect"</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.
            <br><br>
            So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top:
            <br><br>
            The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top:
            <br><br>
            Now we have enough data to create a clickable rectangular area:
            <br><br>
            This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "computer.htm":
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>Shape="circle"</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle:
            <br><br>
            337,300
            Then specify the radius of the circle:
            <br><br>
            44 pixels
            <br><br>
            Now you have enough data to create a clickable circular area:
            <br><br>
            This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "coffee.htm":
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>Shape="poly"</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a
            polygon).
            <br><br>
            This can be used to create any shape.
            <br><br>
            Like maybe a croissant shape!
            <br><br>
            How can we make the croissant in the image below become a clickable link?
            <br><br>
            We have to find the x and y coordinates for all edges of the croissant:
            <br><br>
            The coordinates come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis:
            <br><br>
            This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "croissant.htm":
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>Image Map and JavaScript</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function.
            <br><br>
            Add a click event to the area element to execute a JavaScript function:
        </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the HTML map element to define an image map</li>
        <li>Use the HTML area element to define the clickable areas in the image map</li>
        <li>Use the HTML usemap attribute of the img element to point to an image map</li>
    </ul>
